## instruction about run file locally

**at first** you need to download the files from my github. link is-

```
https://github.com/pobittra1/nosql-backend-project
```

1. open the link and download files in your local machine as format like that zip or anything.

if you download as zip file, so you need to extract files and open with vs code or any code editor.

2. then install again **node_modules**. that command is **"npm i"**.
   for this instalation, install all packages about my project that i have used here.

3. then update mongodb uri. you can keep your mongodb uri. after connect this- you can follow my scripts in **package.json** file to run this project.

finally, you will be able to run my project in your local machine.

thanks.
